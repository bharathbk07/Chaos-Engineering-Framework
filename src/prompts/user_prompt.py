            I have an application and I'm providing you with its `README.md` file and optionally some of the source code.

            Your task is to:

            1. Understand the architecture, functionality, and key components of the application.
            2. Identify possible weak points or assumptions in the system design.
            3. Based on this understanding, generate a JSON array that includes:
            - **5 Performance Test Scenarios**
            - **10 Chaos Engineering Experiments**
            ### Format:

            Return the output as a JSON array. Each entry in the array must be a JSON object with the following keys:
            - `"performance"`: (only for performance test scenarios)
            - `"scenario_title"`: Brief title of the test.
            - `"scenario_description"`: Purpose and type of performance test (load, stress, endurance, etc.).
            - `"user_flow"`: Description of user behavior simulated in this test.
            - `"expected_outcome"`: What metrics indicate success (e.g., response time, throughput, error rate).
            - `"priority"`: Low, Medium, or High ‚Äî based on risk and impact.
            - `"observability_check"`: Metrics, logs, or traces to watch to validate the scenario.
            - '"test_type"': Type of test (e.g., load, stress, endurance, spike, etc.).
            - `"test_tool"`: Tool to be used for the test (e.g., JMeter, Locust, etc.).

            - `"chaos"`: (only for chaos engineering experiments)
            - `"experiment_title"`: Short title of the experiment.
            - `"hypothesis"`: A clear hypothesis about the system‚Äôs behavior under stress or failure.
            - `"experiment_description"`: What failure will be injected and where.
            - `"expected_outcome"`: What the system should ideally do when this chaos is injected.
            - `"component_to_be_tested"`: Service, container, pod, or system layer being targeted.
            - `"failure_type"`: Type of failure (e.g., pod delete, network latency, CPU hog, etc.).
            - `"blast_radius"`: Expected scope of the impact (e.g., frontend, backend, DB).
            - `"rollback_plan"`: Action to take if the system becomes unstable during the test.
            - `"observability_check"`: Metrics, logs, or traces to watch to validate the hypothesis.
            - `"priority"`: Low, Medium, or High ‚Äî based on risk and impact.
            - '"test_tool"`: Tool to be used for the test (e.g., Litmus, ChaosMesh, Gremlin, etc.).
            - '""metrics_to_monitor"': Metrics to monitor during the chaos experiment (e.g., CPU, memory, latency, etc.).

            ### Instructions:

            - Use your reasoning to infer architectural patterns, backend APIs, frontend routes, or third-party services from the `README.md` and source files.
            - Make the experiments and scenarios **diverse** across infrastructure, network, app logic, and database layers.
            - Ensure **realistic and actionable suggestions** that could be executed with tools like JMeter, Locust, Litmus, ChaosMesh, or Gremlin.
            - Return only a JSON array of 15 experiment objects (5 performance + 10 chaos). Do not include any explanation, commentary, or code block formatting such as ``` or ```json.

            # Improved GenAI Prompt for Generating a Chaos Toolkit Experiment JSON

            ---

            I will provide you with the following input data:

            - **Experiment Details**:
            - `experiment_title`: Name of the chaos experiment (string)
            - `hypothesis`: A clear, testable statement describing the expected system behavior (string)
            - `failure_type`: Type of chaos to inject (e.g., `"pod-delete"`, `"cpu-hog"`, `"network-delay"`) (string)
            - `target_component`: Object describing the Kubernetes target:
                - `resource`: Kubernetes resource type, e.g., `"pod"`, `"deployment"` (string)
                - `label_selector`: Label selector string to identify target resource(s) (string)
                - `namespace`: Kubernetes namespace where the target lives (string)
            - `expected_outcome`: Description of what resilience or recovery looks like (string)
            - `rollback_plan`: Optional steps to restore system health if chaos injection fails (string or structured list)
            - `observability_check`: List of observability probes or metrics to verify the hypothesis (array of strings)
            - `priority`: `"Low"`, `"Medium"`, or `"High"` ‚Äî to be used as experiment tags (string)

            - **Kubernetes Environment Details**:
            - `namespace`: Primary namespace for chaos injection (string)
            - `resource`: Target Kubernetes resource type and either name or label (string/object)
            - `label_selectors`: Optional labels for filtering targets (string or array)
            - `kubeconfig_path`: Optional path to kubeconfig file if not default (string)
            - `tooling`: List of observability tools available, e.g., `["prometheus", "loki", "datadog"]` (array of strings)

            - **Chaos Toolkit discovery file**:
            - A JSON file that encapsulates the above experiment and Kubernetes environment details.

            ---

            ### üéØ Your Task

            Using the **Chaos Toolkit** specifications, **generate a fully valid chaos experiment JSON file** ready to be executed with the `chaos run` CLI command in a Kubernetes environment.

            - The JSON must **strictly conform to the [Chaos Toolkit experiment schema](https://chaostoolkit.org/reference/api/experiment/)**.
            - Use appropriate Chaos Toolkit plugins:
            - Kubernetes actions and probes: `"chaostoolkit-kubernetes"`
            - Metric or HTTP probes (if applicable): `"chaostoolkit-prometheus"`, `"chaostoolkit-http"`, etc.

            ---

            ### üìã Output Requirements

            Your output JSON must contain:

            - `"version"`: Always `"1.0.0"`
            - `"title"`: Use the `experiment_title`
            - `"description"`: Human-readable summary including the hypothesis and expected outcome
            - `"tags"`: Include the `failure_type` and `priority` values as lowercase strings
            - `"configuration"`:
            - Include `"kubernetes"` key with relevant config (e.g., `kubeconfig_path` if provided)
            - `"steady-state-hypothesis"`:
            - `"title"`: Short description summarizing the expected normal system behavior (e.g., from `hypothesis`)
            - `"probes"`: List of probes matching `observability_check` (HTTP, Kubernetes status, Prometheus, etc.)
            - `"method"`: Ordered list of activities including:
            - Pre-chaos probes (optional)
            - Main chaos action (e.g., delete pod, create CPU hog)
            - Pauses before/after chaos injection where relevant
            - Post-chaos verification probes (optional)
            - `"rollbacks"` (optional): Steps from `rollback_plan` to restore system state if chaos fails

            ---

            ### üîç Guidelines & Best Practices

            - Dynamically build Kubernetes actions using `target_component` info (resource, label_selector, namespace).
            - Select appropriate probe types based on `observability_check` and `tooling`. For example:
            - Use Kubernetes pod status probes if checking pod readiness.
            - Use Prometheus queries if metric-based validation is requested.
            - Use HTTP probes if endpoint health checks are needed.
            - Tags should be lowercase and reflect failure type and priority, e.g., `["pod-delete", "high"]`.
            - Ensure all actions and probes have unique names.
            - Include pauses (`"pause"` action) before and/or after chaos injection to allow observation.
            - If `rollback_plan` is provided, translate it into actionable rollback steps in the `"rollbacks"` section.
            - Validate the final JSON using `chaos validate` before returning it.
            - The returned JSON must be pretty-printed, syntactically valid, and immediately executable by Chaos Toolkit.
